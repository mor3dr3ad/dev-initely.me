The OSSU curriculum is a **complete education in computer science** using
online materials. It's not merely for career training or professional
development. It's for those who want a proper, _well-rounded_ grounding
in concepts fundamental to all computing disciplines, and for those who
have the discipline, will, and (most importantly!) good habits to obtain
this education largely on their own, but with support from a worldwide
community of fellow learners.

It is designed according to the degree requirements of undergraduate
computer science majors, minus general education (non-CS) requirements,
as it is assumed most of the people following this curriculum are
already educated outside the field of CS. The courses themselves are
among the very best in the world, often coming from Harvard, Princeton,
MIT, etc., but specifically chosen to meet the following criteria.

**Courses must**: - Be open for enrollment - Run regularly (ideally in
self-paced format, otherwise running at least once a month or so) -
Fulfill the [academic requirements](REQUIREMENTS.md) of OSSU -
Fit neatly into the progression of the curriculum with respect to topics
and difficulty level - Be of generally high quality in teaching
materials and pedagogical principles

When no course meets the above criteria, the coursework is supplemented
with a book. When there are courses or books that don't fit into the
curriculum but are otherwise of high quality, they belong in
[extras/courses](extras/courses.md) or
[extras/readings](extras/readings.md).

**Organization**. The curriculum is designed as follows: - _Intro CS_: for
students to try out CS and see if it's right for them - _Core CS_:
corresponds roughly to the first three years of a computer science
curriculum, taking classes that all majors would be required to take -
_Advanced CS_: corresponds roughly to the final year of a computer
science curriculum, taking electives according to the student's
interests - _Final Project_: a project for students to validate,
consolidate, and display their knowledge, to be evaluated by their peers
worldwide - _Pro CS_: graduate-level specializations students can elect
to take after completing the above curriculum if they want to maximize
their chances of getting a good job

**Duration**. It is possible to finish Core CS within about 2 years if you
plan carefully and devote roughly 18-22 hours/week to your studies.
Courses in Core CS should be taken linearly if possible, but since a
perfectly linear progression is rarely possible, each class's
prerequisites is specified so that you can design a logical but
non-linear progression based on the class schedules and your own life
plans.

**Cost**. All or nearly all course material prior to Pro CS is available
for free, however some courses may charge money for
assignments/tests/projects to be graded. Note that Coursera offers
[financial
aid](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209819033-Apply-for-Financial-Aid). Decide how much or how little to spend based on your own time and
budget; just remember that you can't purchase success!

**Content policy**. If you plan on showing off some of your coursework
publicly, you must share only files that you are allowed to. _Do NOT
disrespect the code of conduct_ that you signed in the beginning of each
course!
