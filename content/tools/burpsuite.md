## What is Burpsuite and why should I use it? {#what-is-burpsuite-and-why-should-i-use-it}

As weâ€™ve already hinted at, Burp Suite is a sort of Dev Tools on steroids. Itâ€™s a suite of web app tools that intercepts traffic and lets you inspect it, modify it, and even automate your testing.

But you donâ€™t need to be a professional or have a ton of add-ons to get value from it. Being able to easily see and modify requests, and automate/create new requests will be a big help to you as a newbie, too.

As with most GUI-based tools, you wonâ€™t always be able to use them (for example, if you are limited to command-line tools on a server you are testing). So itâ€™s still important to know the basics, like cURL, netcat, etc. probably should do so. ðŸ™‚


## What can I use it for? {#what-can-i-use-it-for}

Basically you can use burpsuite whenever you want to intercept, examine, manipulate and change requests to or from a webserver. The core of burpsuite is the proxy which intercepts a web request and lets you change parameters, payloads, etc.
